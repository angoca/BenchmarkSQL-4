BenchmarkSQL
============

BenchmarkSQL runs a TPC-C like test against relational databases to compare
performance across versions, settings, and vendors.
This application is supported by different database manager systems:

 * PostgreSQL.
 * IBM Db2 (LUW).

This tool can be easily extended to use another RDBMS.
Instructions to do this are in the Wiki.

You can check the documentation by:

* Reading the HOW-TO-RUN files under the `docs` directory.
* Access the Wiki - https://github.com/ECI-SGBD/BenchmarkSQL-4/wiki.

This is a fork of the BenchmarkSQL 4.
There are other most recent versions of this tool, BenchmarkSQL 5 and
BenchmarkSQL; however, these versions are not as generic as this one, because
many Java classes should be modified in order to make it work.

BenchmarkSQL is open source, distributed under the GNU General Public License
version 2.0 (GPLv2) license.
