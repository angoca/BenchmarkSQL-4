BenchmarkSQL
============

BenchmarkSQL runs a TPC-C like test against relational databases to compare performance across versions, settings, and vendors.
PostgreSQL and other databases are supported.

BenchmarkSQL is Open Source, distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2) license.

You can check the documentation by:

* Reading the HOW-TO-RUN files in the root directory.
* Access the Wiki - https://github.com/ECI-SGBD/BenchmarkSQL-4/wiki.

This is a fork of the BenchmarkSQL 4.
The most recent version, BenchmarkSQL 5, is not as generic as this one, and many Java classes should be modified in order to make it work.
